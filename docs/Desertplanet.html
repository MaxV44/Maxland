<p>The planet Igunides is rich in natural meteals and oils, however it suffers flensing storms across its surface. Streams of tiny obsidian shards are blown by hurricane force winds. They can easily skeletonize an unprotected man. </p>
<p style="color:blue;">Mission rule-Flensing Storms! Each battle turn (at the start of the turn) a d6 is rolled to determine storm severity.<br/>

	1	Lull in the storm. No impact.<br/>

	2-5	All infantry units suffer an automatic hit at Str 3 AP 6<br/>

	6	Oh shit! Gusts! 	All infantry units suffer an automatic hit at Str 7 AP 4.



The hits are resolved at once for both players.
