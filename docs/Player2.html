<h1>Percival the Perfect Praetorian, Paladin of Slaanesh</h1>
<p>Percival seethed with frustration because he was fundamentally a conceited dandy who dreamed of being by Fulgrimâ€™s side as he perfectly stormed the palace. Instead he was here, very far from Terra indeed.<br/>
He and his cohort of the 70th millennial enjoyed some of the first successful sonic enhancement surgeries conducted by apothecaries trained by the spider himself! Because of this dubious honor they had been stationed at this very frontier of the crusade in the Willrike sector; so that their new abilities would be little noticed. <br/>
Now he was cut off here in this hinterland by the Ruinstorm and left with miserable hit and run raids (even if perfectly conducted)!<br/>
When his seers had informed him of the returning treasure he leapt at the chance for glory! So long overdue! </p>
