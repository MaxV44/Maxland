<h1>Week zero. <a href="Mechanicum.html" >Mechanicum</a> and Ultramarines Vs <a href="Player2.html">Emperor's Children</a></h1>
<p><a href="Mechanicum.html" >Mechanicum</a> and Ultramarine victory!</p>
<p>On the desert planet of Igunides a band of noise marines was intercepted by the joint Mechanicum / Ultramarine task force that had just saved the primary hive of Rogotune from the Orks. 

    In a pitched battle amongst the seething obsidian dust storms the Emperor’s Children were soundly beaten (fortunately they enjoy that sort of thing). Unfortunately for them, it seems that they gained almost no information and were soundly beaten. 
    
    In contrast, the agents of the Mechanicum were able to recover information that has led to crucial forge facility reserves that had been stored for military emergencies.

<p style="color:blue;">BENEFIT TO MECHANICUM & ULTRAMARINES:
    One unit gets a boon of reinforced armor plating composed of specialized lightweight alloys. 
    
    Infantry unit:         Unit gains a feel no pain 6+
    Vehicle:                Unit gains reinforced superstructure: Each time an attack with Str 7 or less hits the vehicle’s armor that armor value is treated as 1 higher. (i.e. Armor 11 goes to 12). 
                THERE IS NO EFFECT ON ARMOR 14. (i.e. no Armor 15 you sick monkeys).
    
    THESE BENEFITS LAST UNTIL THE INFANTRY UNIT IS KILLED COMPLETELY OR THE VEHICLE EXPLODES. The replacement unit does not gain the above boon.  PLEASE TRACK FOR ITSELF..</p>
