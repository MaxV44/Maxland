<h1>Welcome to the Orgonergia system!</h1>
<p>The Orgonergia system is a complex trinary of whirling stars nestled in the remains of a great nebula. Though technically the system’s orbits are chaotic their dance is slow by the standards of men.  </p>
<p>The system has long been the heart of the sector. It consists of a large number of planets and asteroid belts. It lies at the center of intra-sector warp routes that are still stable in the face of the raging ruinstorm that walls off Terra from warp travel. Settlement and exploitation extends far back into the Dark Age of Technology.</p>
<p>During this lost age it was rumored that the ancients built something amazing here. The exact nature of the treasure depends upon the telling:

	Rogue traders tell of a grand cruiser from the lost age. Still alive and commanded by an abominable intelligence.

	Imperial army generals have dreamed that the lost treasure trove contains regiments worth of terrifying archeoweapons. 

	The adepts of the mechanicum tell of a lost pleasure station built for the high magi that was capable of building toasters beyond all belief.</p>
<p>The one thing that all legends agree upon is that the treasure was hidden during the Age of Strife. Not destroyed, but hidden. Supposedly somewhere in the sprawling Orgonergia system.</p>
<p>The Orks were the first to arrive, but they were not unexpected. </p>
<p>For months the few remaining astropaths have all been in an uproar. They all see visions of the old treasure, yet none of them can agree upon its nature either. However, part of their visions are in unprecedented agreement: the old treasure is coming back!</p>
<p>The astropaths cannot see past this point, but the commanders certainly can. The time has come to raid the Orgonergia system with what forces can be mustered. The time has come for each contender to try and seize the mysterious prize for themselves! </p>

<h2 style="color:blue;">Week 1!</h2>
<p style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);">Mission 1		1000 to 1500 points (to be matched with opponent)

  “Knock, Knock”</p>
<p>Mission Objectives: Scout out the objectives. If you control an objective at the end of your movement phase (and have not advanced) you can spend your shooting phase examining the objective in lieu of shooting.
  Objectives are placed immediately after deployment is decided but before deployment takes place. The defender places the first objective in no-mans land. Then the attacker places an objective. Each player places three objectives. </p>
  <p style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);">Deployment Zones:
    Short edge deployment. 12” in from board edge.</p>
    <p style="color:rgb(0, 255, 55);">Victory Conditions:



      For each objective explored roll a D6.
      
        1	Explodes!	Large blast template centered on objective. Str 8. AP —
      
        2-5	Information	1D3 VP
      
        6	Mother lode	3 VP + 1d6 x 10 points extra gear for next game.
      
      
      
      Also:
      
      1 VP for each enemy units killed (Kill Points)
      
      1 VP for slay the warlord
      
      1 VP for first blood </p>
      <p style="color:rgb(132, 0, 255);">Special Planetary Conditions: </p>
      <p style="color:rgb(132, 0, 255);">The jovian fuel stations are Zone Mortalis environments.</p>
      <p style="color:rgb(132, 0, 255);">The Ag planet is dominated by wide open spaces. The board should be set up to about half of the usual terrain density. </p>
      <p style="color:rgb(132, 0, 255);">The desert planet suffers flensing storms across its surface. Streams of tiny obsidian shards are blown by hurricane force winds. They can easily skeletonize an unprotected man.<br/> 



        Each battle turn (at the start of the turn) a d6 is rolled to determine storm severity.<br/>
        
          1	Lull in the storm. No impact.<br/>
        
          2-5	All infantry units suffer an automatic hit at Str 3 AP 6<br/>
        
          6	Oh shit! Gusts! 	All infantry units suffer an automatic hit at Str 7 AP 4.
        
        
        
        The hits are resolved at once for both players.</p>
        <p style="color:rgb(132, 0, 255);">The winter planet is a dark iceball far beyond the sun. Its dim surface is fogged and clouded by vast banks of slowly drifting ice crystals.



          It is ALWAYS quasi-night fighting.
        
          
        
          The line of sight limitation is 36 “
        
          BS is -1 for all ranges above 12”
        
          No Leadership penalties.
        
          As in normal night fighting these penalties are not suffered by units with Night Vision.
        
         </p>
