<h1>Welcome to the Orgonergia system!</h1>
<p>The Orgonergia system is a complex trinary of whirling stars nestled in the remains of a great nebula. Though technically the systemâ€™s orbits are chaotic their dance is slow by the standards of men.  </p>
<p>The system has long been the heart of the sector. It consists of a large number of planets and asteroid belts. It lies at the center of intra-sector warp routes that are still stable in the face of the raging ruinstorm that walls off Terra from warp travel. Settlement and exploitation extends far back into the Dark Age of Technology.</p>
<p>During this lost age it was rumored that the ancients built something amazing here. The exact nature of the treasure depends upon the telling:

	Rogue traders tell of a grand cruiser from the lost age. Still alive and commanded by an abominable intelligence.

	Imperial army generals have dreamed that the lost treasure trove contains regiments worth of terrifying archeoweapons. 

	The adepts of the mechanicum tell of a lost pleasure station built for the high magi that was capable of building toasters beyond all belief.</p>
<p>The one thing that all legends agree upon is that the treasure was hidden during the Age of Strife. Not destroyed, but hidden. Supposedly somewhere in the sprawling Orgonergia system.</p>
